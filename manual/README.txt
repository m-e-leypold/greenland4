This directory contains only the sphinx configuration for creating the
manual. The manual files are under ../lib/ side by side with the
python modules they document (this must be considered an experiment).

Note, that lot of manual text just consists of doc strings extracted
from the python source.

See ../LICENSE.txt for the license to be applied to the manual.
